# MapKitDynRoutes

iOS4 library to manage dynamic routes on MKMapView.
This library tries to handle the lack of methods to manage growing routes without
repainting all of those anytime.

##Â Features
FFMapRoute(s) provide two classes that manage a growing route using an algorithm to aggregate points without having the polyline to be redraw/regenerated every time a new point is acquired.
Furthemore, this set of classes, comes with a simulator that injects coordinates using a timer.

## How it works
It works using an incremental way to add segments based on a integer factor.
That value is called kAGGREGATION_FACTOR and its value is set to 3, by default (please, check _kAGGREGATION_FACTOR_ macro in _FFMapRoutes.h_).
In order to explain it better, I'm going to drop you an example.
Let's say the factor is 3 and the tracking begins.
The segment sequence will be:  

A-B, B-C, C-D

-- **aggregation** --
	A-B-C-D
-- **end of aggregation** --

A-B-C-D, D-E, E-F, F-G

-- **aggregation** --
	A-B-C-D, D-E-F-G
-- **end of aggregation** --

A-B-C-D, D-E-F-G, ..

-- **aggregation** --
	...
-- **end of aggregation** --

	A-B-C-D, D-E-F-G, G-H-I-J

-- **aggregation** --
	A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J
-- **end of aggregation** --

and so on.

## Requirements

* Xcode 3.2.3 with iOS 4 SDK or Xcode 4 Preview.
* Project file (.xcodeproj) needs to:

  1. C/C++ Compiler Version (GCC_VERSION) set to "LLVM compiler 1.5"
  2. Other C Flags (OTHER_CFLAGS) should add "-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2" flags. 
  3. Base SDK (SDKROOT) should be "iPhone Device 4.0"
  4. Deployment Target (IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET) can be "iPhone OS 3.1" if you want.

## Note

<code>-Xclang</code> here means "pass argument to the clang compiler," and the argument is <code>-fobjc-nonfragile-abi2</code>. So you should add '**"-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2"**' into $OTHER_CFLAGS as single argument that contains one space in between, and not add them as two arguments like '**-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2**'.

For more details, check ["-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2" is single flag with one argument][1].

## Thanksgiving
I want to say thanks to Walter 'DaK_TaLeS' for spending few nights talking about how to develop the algorithm used by this library and for supporting (and injuring) me all the time.
