# MapKitDynRoutes

iOS4 library to manage dynamic routes on MKMapView.
This library tries to handle the lack of methods to manage growing routes without
repainting all of those anytime.

## Thanksgiving
I want to say thanks to Walter 'DaK_TaLeS' for spending few nights talking about how to develop the algorithm used by this library and for supporting (and injuring) me all the time.

## License

This library and the associated demo are licensed under MIT license.
However, if you are using this library and you want to share with me the fact that it suits your needs, please drop me a line. I'll be glad to hear that.
